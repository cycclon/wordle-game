### Intructions
1. The objective of the game is to guess a secret random word in 6 guesses or less, using a color scheme as hints for each letter
2. Touch (mobile) or click (pc) on the letters in the keypad to add them to the board
3. Once you complete a line of letters press "Enter" key to check against the secret word
4. Depending whether each letter matches the letters in the secret word, you'll see three different colors:
    - Grey: the letter is not in the secret word
    - Yellow: the letter is in the secret word but in a different possition
    - Green: the letter is in the secret word and in the correct possition
5. The keypad will be highlighted with these colors accorgingly

*In this example (secret word "BRISA") the letters "N" and "J" are not present in the secret word; the letter "I" is present but in a different position; finally, the letter "A" is in the correct possition*

You win if you guess the secret word in 6 tries or less
